---+!! JoomlaUsersContrib Contrib Package

*tested with Joomla 1.0.13 and 1.5*


This Contrib enables you to replace the Foswiki User and Groups system with a read only access to the 
User and Groups in a [[http://www.joomla.org/][Joomla]] Database. Registration of new users and their 
association with Groups is then _only_ handled by Joomla, making it possible to remove the distributed Main web.

You are advised to use the same same host for Foswiki and the Joomla Database, 
otherwise user query performance (happens every request) will severely degrade the response time.

*NOTE:* for performance reasons, the Joomla Registered Users group is _not_ brought into the system, 
The other groups may cause performance degradation if they have too many members

By selecting JoomlaLogin, Foswiki will also attempt (has worked on joomla 1.3, but not reliably) to use the Joomla 'remember me' cookie -
 though this requires the Foswiki and Joomla host names to be the same.

---++ Settings

Settings are in =lib/LocalSite.cfg=. the Foswiki configure script does not currently display the non-core options,
 but should also not remove them. See the Installation Instructions below for details.

   * One line description:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = replace the Foswiki User and Groups System with Joomla's

   * Name of the perl package
      * Set STUB = authenticate using the joomla users - disable registration.

---++ Installation Instructions
%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%
   * set Foswiki::Users::JoomlaUserMapping as your UserMapping in configure's Security section
   * set Foswiki::LoginManager::JoomlaLogin as your LoginManager in configure's Security section
   * set none as your PasswordManager in configure's Security section
   * set the ={AdminGroup}= in the configure security section to one of the Joomla groups (such as =Super Administrator=)
   * configure  JoomlaUsersContrib from the *User Managers* / *Joomla User Manager* section in configure
      * this needs a dbi connection string to your Joomla database, and a valid username and password for it.
